			My name is Davina Amiri and I am an Artist's lawyer based in NY. While representing Artists, I have become frustrated with the lack of bargaining power for Artists. 
		%p
		After attending SXSW 2013 and listening to many speakers and experts, I saw the need for a strong aggressive representative voice for musicians in the Music Industry.

			As new technologies rattle the entire Entertainment Industry, now is especially the time for Musicians to come together. Not at the hands of Corporate created organizations, but from the hands of Musicians and Musician lovers as well.
		%p
			This campaign is to help MusicianRights.org get up and running. This social enterprise which will help Musicians regain power in contract negotiations, which means more money for Musicians.
		%p
			I truly believe if all Musicians come together through this organization and agree to certain minimum requirements for contracts, Musicians will finally have an equal playing field in the Music Industry.
